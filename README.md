# The Addiction Code

_An experiment in the analysis of Addiction using Code_

## Purpose

After starting my recovery from alcoholism in November 2018, I explored my understanding of how addiction truly functions. My background in computer programming inspired me to write this essay using non-functional example code (known as **pseudocode**) to explain how and why addiction affects human thoughts and actions. By sharing my understanding, I hope to help others in their struggle with addiction.

## Understanding Addiction Using Code

To understand addiction is to understand the nature of thoughts. I find it helpful to think of the human brain as a computer, a logic machine that consumes input, processes data, and returns output. 

Instead of familiar tools like code, compilers, and computer screens, the brain consumes sensory data and returns a human action.

If we were able to read the source code for the human brain, we could understand how the complex things we experience become the lives we live. We could also debug the program, to better understand and treat tragic human conditions such as alcoholism.

## Code For Thoughts

Here's my code for a `Thought` object that stores an arbitrary idea:

```
object Thought(idea):
  this.idea = idea
```

As the brain processes stimuli from the body, it instantiates them into `Thoughts`:

```
thought_1 = new Thought("The pizza in that commercial looked tasty.")

thought_2 = new Thought("When does the new season of my favorite show start?")

thought_3 = new Thought("I stayed up way too late last night.")
```

## Thoughts Into Actions

The brain converts these `Thoughts` into decisions for action. Lets say we stored the above example `Thoughts` in a stack called `currentThoughts`. Here's my code to convert `Thoughts` into `Actions`.

```
function currentThoughtsIntoActions():
  action = new Action()
  foreach thought in currentThoughts:
    action.consider(thought.idea)
  action.execute()
```

The predicted human behavior for this stack of `currentThoughts` would involve ordering pizza, checking Netflix, and getting to bed early.

## The Code For Addiction

Addiction is a mutation in the `Thought` code that appends an additional `Thought` for a constant `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE`. 

```
define ADDICTIVE_DESIRE = "I should drink alcohol."

object Thought(idea):
    this.idea = idea
    if idea is not ADDICTIVE_DESIRE:
        new Thought(ADDICTIVE_DESIRE)
```

In the addicted mind, the stack of `currentThoughts` becomes inundated with new `Thoughts` of the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE`. 

```
foreach thought in currentThoughts
   print thought.idea

> "The pizza in that commercial looked tasty."
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "When does the new season of my favorite show start?"
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "I stayed up way too late last night."
> "I should drink alcohol."
```

## The Slow Crush Of Repetition

These `Thoughts` of `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` seem like harmless noise, even easy to ignore. The brain continues to process stimuli into human behavior, without any sign of general malfunction. Irrational and dangerous behavior is excused as being occasional and unusual, an anomaly in an otherwise heathy system.

However, because `Thoughts` of `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` are being created in equal numbers to normal `Thoughts`, eventually the `Actions` become irresponsible, unhealthy, and dangerous. Here's another stack of normal `Thoughts`:

```
currentThoughts = [
  new Thought("Time to drive to work."),
  new Thought("I have to finish that important report by the end of today."),
  new Thought("The meeting this afternoon will be long and boring.")
]
```

In a mind with an `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE`, these `currentThoughts` could lead to `Actions` with disasterous consequences.

```
foreach thought in currentThoughts
   print thought.idea

> "I have to finish that important report by the end of today."
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "The meeting this afternoon will be long and boring."
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "Time to drive home from work."
> "I should drink alcohol."
```

This illustrates the subversive and overwhelming nature of addiction. 

## Complications In Recovery

### The Addicted Thought Paradox

The mutation of `Thought` makes an addict struggle to take `Actions` to get help. Because the addict has to believe, and therefore have `Thoughts`, that they should not do what the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` leads them to do, the essence of the mutation inhibits its treatment. 

```
foreach thought in currentThoughts
   print thought.idea

> "I should stay home and not party tonight."
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "I'm too hungover to get anything done today."
> "I should drink alcohol."
> "I should stop drinking."
> "I should drink alcohol."
```

Unfortunately, until a human's addiction is fully understood and diagnosed, all their selfish and destructive human behavior is interpreted — both by others and by the addict themselves — to be willing decisions. To the addict, the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` just seems like a normal part of thinking. Their inability to overcome their `Thought` mutation is seen as personal weakness, or worse, indifference. 

### Indulgence's Downward Spiral

When exposed to the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` itself, the recursive nature of the mutation inevitably overwhelms the addict's `currentThoughts` and leads to disasterous consequences.

```
foreach thought in currentThoughts
   print thought.idea

> "I'll have a beer.",
> "I should drink alcohol.",
> "I'll order a shot too.",
> "I should drink alcohol.",
> "I'll order more beers and shots.",
> "I should drink alcohol.",
> "I'm feeling dizzy.",
> "I should drink alcohol.",
> "I can't walk straight.",
> "I should drink alcohol."
```

An addict who continues this pattern will inevitably end up in a psychiatric institution, in jail, or dead.

## How Coding The Mind Can Help Recovery

I've found this method of addiction analysis extremely helpful in my own recovery. It gave me the means to overcome the largest obstacles in my recovery.

1. The logic of the code explained why it's virtually impossible for the addict to overcome their addiction alone. You compete ineterally against something that hijacked 50% of your thoughts. Addicts need outside help and support to bring balance to the percentage of thinking about their `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE`.

1. Using code allowed me to externalize the addiction from normal `Thoughts`, which gave me space to condemn the consequences of the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` without condemning myself. I could now be angry and disappointed with the actions I had committed, without bearing the entire weight of responsibility.

1. Code makes it vividly clear why abstaining from the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` is paramount to recovery. The mutation abhors the idea of abstinence, as its sole purpose is to consume endlessly. Recovery depends on the strength of thoughts leading away from the `ADDICTIVE_DESIRE` in all its forms, and as illustrated in **Indulgence's Downward Spiral**, failure to abstain will inevitably lead to disaster.

## Conclusion

Until we can truly decompile, analyze, and patch the inner workings of the human brain, we cannot truly repair the addicted mind. But by using a computer model of the brain as a way of understanding thoughts and behavior, we hopefully can develop new methods of successful addiction treatment.
